YMMV\n\nIf you like the theme, please :star: it, or send pull requests if you think you can improve it!\n\n![Sepia screenshot dark](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57252/Screenshot%202015-02-23%2017.51.29.png)\n\n![Sepia screenshot light](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57252/Screenshot%202015-02-23%2017.51.04.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lucaska/sepia-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/lucaska/sepia-syntax#readme","_id":"sepia-syntax@1.0.5","_shasum":"d6e5eb2f722ac30225f39c33908cda7a51c97a88","_resolved":"file:../d-116230-14164-tx0d7e/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116230-14164-tx0d7e/package.tgz"}
